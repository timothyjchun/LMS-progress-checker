## How it helps you with productivity

If you are a student of a college that uses Canvas and LMS, I'm pretty sure your **Weekly Assignments** page might look something like this.

Its nice and tidy.. but the problem is that all those assignments and online lectures are hard to know when its due, and whether its finished or not
I'm sure a lot of students will share the same emotions that I feel when I clicked into a assignment just to realize that its due in 1hour, or when I click an online video too late, marking me absent tho I didn't even know the sole _existence_ of the lecture.

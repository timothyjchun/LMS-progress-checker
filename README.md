# LMS-progress-checker ✅🫠
_LMS progress checker is a chrome extension to boost your productivity when working on college websites that provide services via Canvas and LMS_

_❗️ it it not yet deployed. Will be soon_


## How it helps you with productivity

If you are a student of a college that uses Canvas and LMS, I'm pretty sure your **Weekly Assignments** page might look something like this :

![before2](https://github.com/timothyjchun/LMS-progress-checker/assets/62375259/b1176766-78ec-4543-9637-cc5670ed1a10)

Its nice and tidy.. but the problem is that all those assignments and online lectures are **hard to know when its due**, and whether **its finished or not**
I'm sure a lot of students will share the same emotions that I feel when I clicked into a assignment just to realize that its due in 1hour, or when I click an online video too late, marking me absent tho I didn't even know the sole _existence_ of the lecture.


To solve this I've developed a chrome extension that automatically shows you the **d-day of the assignment** and the **status of the assignment/lecture** for every single item on the course like so :

Every different emoji shows different status about the item.

The extension runs every time the user accesses a course page, so it is 100% dynamic.


## Prerequisites
Nothing! Don't need to provide any personal information or anything. Just make sure you're in a **Chrome** environment, cuz it's a chrome extension 😉



## Whats in the future?
Caching user course information for instant visibility is what I'm working on 🧑‍💻

Plus, I'm working on providing english and other languages.
